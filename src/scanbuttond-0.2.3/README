Scanner Button Daemon (scanbuttond), Version 0.2.3
==================================================


First things first
------------------

This software is in its very early stages of development. Although this daemon
seems to work for most people, there may still be lots of critical bugs.
Be prepared for the worst!


Introduction
------------

Modern scanners usually have several front panel buttons which are intended to
trigger certain actions like copying, faxing or mailing the scanned document.
This daemon monitors the scanner's buttons and runs a shell script whenever one
of these buttons has been pressed. Because it is accessing the scanner directly
via libusb, there should be no conflicts with SANE or other scanner drivers:
scanbuttond simply won't touch the scanner hardware while you are using SANE.


Requirements
------------

 * Scanner: see "supported scanners" below
 * Operating system: Linux (and perhaps other Unix-like systems)
 * Connection: USB (using libusb, the scanner kernel module is currently
   unsupported)


Compilation & Installation
--------------------------

Since version 0.2.3, scanbuttond uses the GNU autotools for compilation &
installation. Please see the file INSTALL for generic instructions on using
them.

If you are using a CVS version instead of a release, you may have to bootstrap
the package. This can be done by running:
"aclocal; autoconf; autoheader; automake -a; libtoolize". 
You should now be able to run ./configure and make.

After you have installed scanbuttond, you should run "ldconfig" to update the
cache of the dynamic linker. If you forget to do that, scanbuttond probably
won't be able to load the backend modules or resolve the dependencies between
them!


Usage
-----

If you just want to try out scanbuttond, type
> scanbuttond

If everyhing works, scanbuttond will fork() to background. To see what
scanbuttond is doing, you can have a look at your system log, for example
/var/log/everything/current (for Gentoo Linux systems running metalog).

To terminate scanbuttond, type
> killall scanbuttond
That should do the job. Scanbuttond installs a signal handler which should
ensure a clean shutdown even when it's killed.

If you intend to use scanbuttond seriously, you would probably want to write a
distribution-specific init-script for starting and stopping the daemon.

Supported by the snapscan backend (via libusb):
* Epson Perfection 2480 (expected to work)
* Epson Perfection 2580 (expected to work)
* Epson Perfection 1670 (working, tested)

Note: the mustek, niash, plustek, plustek_umax and snapscan backends were
implemented using information gathered by "sniffing" the communication between
the Windows driver and the scanner, because there is no technical documentation
available for these devices! This means that there may be some weird issues
(e.g. button press events reported twice).


How to link actions to buttons
------------------------------

Whenever a scanner button has been pressed, scanbuttond starts a shell script
and passes it the button number and the SANE scanner name as command line
arguments. By default, this shell script is installed as
"/usr/local/etc/scanbuttond/buttonpressed.sh". Please modify it to fit your
purposes.


Scanner initialization
----------------------

Note: this only applies to some scanners supported by the non-epson backends.
All scanners supported by the epson backend do not need special initialization.

Some scanners require a special initialization procedure (firmware uploading,
for example) before they can be used by scanbuttond. Since the scanbuttond
backend modules cannot yet handle such operations, the initialization has to be
performed by external programs, for example by "scanimage" which is part of
SANE. You can customize the initialization procedure by editing the scanner
initialization script, which is by default installed at
"/usr/local/etc/scanbuttond/initscanner.sh". This script will be executed
whenever a new device has to be initialized. In most cases, it should be
sufficient to put something like "scanimage -n" into this script.


How to contribute to this project
---------------------------------

The development of scanbuttond should not be dependent on one single person, 
but a community effort.
You could help by ...

 * adding or enhancing a scanner backend
 * adding or enhancing a connection interface
 * doing some extensive testing
 * sending patches
 * sending bug reports
 * mailing ideas how to enhance scanbuttond
 * ...
